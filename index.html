            <p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints places a great importance on the building of temples and the ordinances administered within those sacred walls. Faithful Latter-day Saints across the world prepare to receive their endowment in these temples. But the endowment and its associated ceremony have a rich and long history that has resulted in various changes and adaptations to better serve the ordinance’s recipients. This article will provide a greater understanding of the historical events leading up to the endowment and the presentation of the endowment. Specifically, the Kirtland Endowment will be explained, the later Nauvoo Endowment described, and their similarities and differences defined.</p>

            <h6>The Endowment and Presentation of the Endowment</h6>
            <p>While many use the term endowment to refer to both the gift received as well as the religious presentation, there is a difference between the endowment and the presentation of the endowment. The Church of Jesus Christ provides a webpage specifically about the endowment, in this page they say:</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                <p>“The word endowment means “a gift.” In this context, the temple endowment is a gift of sacred blessings from God to each of us. The endowment can only be received in His way and in His holy temple. Some of the gifts you receive through the temple endowment include:</p>
            
                <ol>
                    <li>Greater knowledge of the Lord’s purposes and teachings.</li>
                    <li>Power to do all that God wants us to do.</li>
                    <li>Divine guidance and protection as we serve the Lord, our families, and others.</li>
                    <li>Increased hope, comfort, and peace.</li>
                    <li>Promised blessings now and forever.”<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></li>
                </ol>
            
            </div>

            <p>Therefore, the <i>endowment</i> is a gift of power from God. The <i>presentation of the endowment</i> is the ceremony or set of instructions that allows members to learn about and receive this gift, or endowment.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> Both the endowment and the presentation have different historical origins and time periods, as will be discussed further. Endowment, as used in the remaining portion of this article, specifically refers to the power and capacity, not the method or presentation of the endowment.</p>

            <h6>References to the Endowment Prior to the Kirtland Endowment</h6>
            <p>The origins of the endowment are often said to be first the Kirtland Endowment, and then the Nauvoo Endowment. While this is correct, there are references to the spiritual endowment of power long before either of these events occurred. </p>
            <p>Beginning in 1831, the Prophet Joseph Smith received various revelations that, while maybe not fully understood at the time of reception, were fundamental to the development of the endowment. The most prominent of these revelations is Doctrine and Covenants 88.</p>

            <h6>The School of the Prophets and the Kirtland Endowment</h6>
            <p>Doctrine and Covenants 88 became an essential preparation for future recipients of this sacred gift. Prior to the Kirtland Temple being completed, Joseph Smith gathered a group of Elders, later referred to as the School of the Prophets, to prepare to receive the endowment. The main priority of this group was to become holy in preparation for a great spiritual gift. The ordinance of the washing of feet was introduced in the School of the Prophets (D&C 88:139-141). The school also required participants to enter only after agreeing to a bond of fellowship and to covenant to obey the commandments (D&C 88:133), or in other words after ensuring that they were worthy. D&C 88:137 summarized the goal of the School of the Prophets, “that it may become a sanctuary, a tabernacle of the Holy Spirit to your edification.”</p>
            <p>Upon completion, the Kirtland temple provided a place where the Saints could receive their promised endowment. While the presentation of the endowment that is currently familiar in the Church was not presented here, the spiritual gifts received have resemblances to the later presentation in Nauvoo.</p>
            <p>In the dedication of the Kirtland temple, Joseph prayed that the members who enter “may grow up in thee, and receive a fullness of the Holy Ghost, and be organized according to thy laws” (D&C 109:15). According to Latter-day Saint scholar Steven Harper: </p>
            <div class="quote">
                <p>“Joseph prayed, in other words, a temple prayer that the Saints would become like their Heavenly Father by degrees of glory as they obeyed his laws and prepared to enter his presence. He prayed for what section 88 taught him to pray for.” <sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>
            </div>
            <p>As the Elders entered the Kirtland temple to receive this endowment of power, they went through a process of washing to become clean, receiving anointings, and blessing one another.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> Joseph recorded in his journal that “to this end, washing, anointing, and blessing the presidents of quorums began 21 and 22 January 1836.” <sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> While the stretch of weeks in early 1836 brought about new ordinances and great power to the Saints in preparation to preach the gospel, the endowment was left relatively unclear and unchanged until the Nauvoo era. President Brigham Young later summarized the Kirtland endowment well, saying that those who participated “received a portion of their endowments, or we might say more clearly, some of the first, or introductory, or initiatory ordinances, preparatory to an endowment.” <sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup></p>
            
            <h6>The Nauvoo Endowment</h6>
            <p>Amid persecution in the early 1840’s, Joseph sensed the urgency in which he needed to fully give the endowment to the Saints. The Nauvoo temple was under construction and would be a sacred place for these ordinances, but Joseph knew he did not have time to wait until its completion. In May of 1842, Joseph introduced the endowment ceremony to a group of men in the upper room of his red brick store. This ceremony was later introduced to women. Because the temple was not yet complete, Joseph rearranged the upper room of his store to represent different stages of man’s journey back to God.</p>
            <p>After the martyrdom, the Saints continued their work on the temple as they sensed their time in Nauvoo was limited. They dedicated the attic area of the temple for ordinance work in late 1845. Following the example of Joseph, they rearranged the room into separate areas representing different stages in the journey to God, the final destination represented the Celestial Kingdom. On the edges of this central hall there were six rooms for offices, initiatory ordinances, and sealings. By the end of 1945 into early 1946, around 5,500 Saints had received their endowment in the Nauvoo Temple.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup></p>
            <p>The significance of the endowment can be seen through the Saints’ determination to receive these ordinances amid persecution and threats to leave Nauvoo. Even while the temple was yet to be completed, dedicated portions of the temple were utilized to receive sacred, saving ordinances.</p>
            
            <h6>Temples After the Nauvoo Period</h6>
            <p>While the Kirtland and Nauvoo temples both contain large meeting halls, with smaller areas for ordinances, the building of temples in the Utah region and later around the world would show gradual changes demonstrating the importance of sacred ordinances. Latter-day Saint scholar Richard O. Cowan points out that temples gradually changed from primarily a gathering place to a space to receive the endowment. The St. George temple, the first dedicated after Nauvoo, was the first to have vicarious ordinances performed. The St. George temple still had two main assembly halls similar to the Nauvoo and Kirtland Temples. The Manti and Logan temples were the first to see a designated floor for ordinance rooms, with the upper space still being reserved for general meetings. The Salt Lake Temple followed this pattern with large ordinance rooms allowing for more people to attend at once. After the era of temples in Utah, the pattern changed from being a hybrid space for ordinances and meetings, to a building fully designed for baptisms for the dead, presentation of the endowment, and sealings. Another major change came in 1955, when the Swiss Temple was dedicated and used films to present portions of the endowment.<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup></p>
            <p>The Church continues to demonstrate the value of temples as these sacred structures are built at an increasing rate around the world, thus allowing millions of Saints in diverse locations to receive the same ordinances first received form Joseph Smith in the 1830’s and 40’s. While certain methods in the presentation of the endowment have changed, its central purpose and power remains the same. Then Elder Russell M. Nelson reaffirmed the importance and centrality of temple ordinances when he taught that “the supreme benefits of membership in the Church can only be realized only through the exalting ordinances of the temple. These blessings qualify us for “thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers” [D&C 132:19] in the celestial kingdom.” <sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup></p>
            
            <h6>Conclusion</h6>
            <p>The Kirtland and Nauvoo endowments are best seen as consecutive steps in a restorative process. The endowment received in Kirtland was used as a building block for the endowment received in Nauvoo. Continuing after Nauvoo, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has continued to modify the presentation of the endowment to best bring the promised power and capacity, through sacred covenants, into the lives of Latter-day Saints around the world.</p>
